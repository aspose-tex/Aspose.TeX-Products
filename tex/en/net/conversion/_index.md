p1: "Aspose.TeX is an API to the Object TeX system, for detail of Tex file, here is the [Tex introduction](https://docs.aspose.com/tex/cpp/what-is-tex/). Developers can easily convert TeX to PDF, XPS, PNG, JPG, BMP and TIFF formats by integrating the API for C# .NET. Below are few code samples that programmers can enhance and integrate within LaTex solutions."
p2: "The API solution for Java here lets you convert TeX and LaTeX files programmatically, but you may find it useful to see and try [cross-platform Converters](https://products.aspose.app/tex/conversion) developed on these native APIs. There you can also find [applications](https://products.aspose.app/tex/applications) to create and edit TeX files, tables, graphics, to merge files into the one of PDF format, etc."
