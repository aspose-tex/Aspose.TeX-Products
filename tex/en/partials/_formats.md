{{<section TEX>}}

TeX is not actually a format. It is at the same time a programming language and also an interpreter engine that understands this language. A TeX file is a document created in LaTeX. This document can include graphics, tables, symbols, lists, formulas, and equations.

{{<section LATEX>}}

LaTeX is a TeX format if said briefly. LaTeX files are plain text files in ASCII encoding written in their own markup language. They may require the inclusion of other data like images and/or other LaTeX files. LaTeX may provide you with a bunch of advanced features to create tables, include graphics, write math equations, and different formulas, etc. All these features are available in so-called packets.

{{<section XPS>}}

XPS format is similar to PDF format. Both are page description language (PDL) formats. EPS is based on HTML and not on PostScript language. The .eps file is capable to contain a markup of the document's structure along with the information on how the document would look like. There are also added instructions on how to print and render the document. The feature of the format is that it fixes the document's description which means that it will look the same no matter who and from what operational system opens it.

{{<section PDF>}}

Portable Document Format or as many of us know it PDF is a cross-platform open format and one of the most famous in the world. Once developed by Adobe this page description language (PDL) format is now supported by almost every environment or operating system and can be read by almost every device.

{{<section BMP>}}

Bitmap Image File or BMP is a raster-saving image format. It is used to save bitmap digital images and is capable to store 2d graphics in color or monochrome in the high quality as the TIFF format does. It also can contain image information like data compression, color profiles, alpha channels, etc. BMP images are independent of the graphics adapter so the files can be opened on multiple platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac.


{{<section GIF>}}

Graphics Interchange Format as it is known worldwide as GIF is a graphic format for light-weighted animation. It is a bitmap image format with lossless compression. It is perfect for creating content with a limited number of colors, for low-quality videos. You may find GIFs on any social network, messenger, or other communication solution.

{{<section JPEG>}}

The Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) format is the most popular and supported image format. It is used as a default format by many devices and systems through JPG loses its quality when compressed. It is possible to add keywords to a JPEG image. When loading such pictures they will be indexed according to these keywords and be shown in the search result according to them. Because of this JPEG format is well spread on e-commerce platforms in listings.

{{<section PNG>}}

Portable Network Graphics or PNG is one of the most popular image formats. It gives you really good compression maintaining the high level of quality of the picture. PNG is also one of the best formats for web projects, as the files are lighter and images are easy to scale. One drawback of the format when used on the web is that it is not possible to add keywords to the image directly.

{{<section TIFF>}}

The Tag Image File Format format is a format spread among photographers. It lets keep really high-quality images, like fabulous macro photos of flowers, insects, or dew drops you may have seen. TIFF stores image information and raster graphics. Storing that much information makes the images of this format pretty heavy, so TIFF is not good in cases when you need to save space.

{{<section SVG>}}

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a Page Description Language based on XML/ It is developed to create two-dimensional vector and mixed vector/raster graphics. SVG document is a text file that describes images as geometric primitives: lines, curves, shapes, text, etc. The file includes a set of commands, formulas, and numbers to define the vector objects.
