p1: "Aspose.TeX is an API to the Object TeX system, for detail of Tex file, here is the [Tex introduction](https://docs.aspose.com/tex/cpp/what-is-tex/). Developers can easily convert TeX to PDF, XPS, PNG, JPG, BMP and TIFF formats by integrating the API for C++. Below are few code samples that programmers can enhance and integrate within LaTex solutions."
p2: "The API solution for Java here lets you convert TeX and LaTeX files programmatically, but you may find it useful to see and try [cross-platform Converters](https://products.aspose.app/tex/conversion) developed on these native APIs. There you can also find [applications](https://products.aspose.app/tex/applications) to create and edit TeX files, tables, graphics, to merge files into the one of PDF format, etc."

item2: "Create instance of the [TeXOptions Class](https://reference.aspose.com/tex/cpp/class/aspose.te_x.te_x_options)."
item3:  "Define the image type and size using [*ImageDevice*](https://reference.aspose.com/page/cpp/class/aspose.page.e_p_s.device.image_device)."
item4: "Specify the file system working directory for the output/input using [*OutputWorkingDirectory*](https://reference.aspose.com/tex/cpp/class/aspose.te_x.te_x_options#aa4f4ea6dab7db5ba1b40800495f16f63)/[InputWorkingDirectory](https://reference.aspose.com/tex/cpp/class/aspose.te_x.te_x_options#aa4f4ea6dab7db5ba1b40800495f16f63)."
