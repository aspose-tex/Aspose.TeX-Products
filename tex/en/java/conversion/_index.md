p1: "Aspose.TeX is an API to the Object TeX system, for detail of Tex file, here is the [Tex introduction](https://docs.aspose.com/tex/cpp/what-is-tex/). Developers can easily convert TeX to PDF, XPS, PNG, JPG, BMP and TIFF formats by integrating the API for Java. Below are few code samples that programmers can enhance and integrate within Tex solutions."
p2: "The API solution for Java here lets you convert TeX and LaTeX files programmatically, but you may find it useful to see and try [cross-platform Converters](https://products.aspose.app/tex/conversion) developed on these native APIs. There you can also find [applications](https://products.aspose.app/tex/applications) to create and edit TeX files, tables, graphics, to merge files into the one of PDF format, etc."
