1. Initialize [TeXOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/tex/java/com.aspose.tex/TeXOptions) to create conversion options for Object LaTeX format
2. In order to set space, or area, where the TeX output will be written, set system working directory for the output using [OutputWorkingDirectory](https://apireference.aspose.com/tex/java/com.aspose.tex/TeXOptions#getOutputWorkingDirectory--)
3. Initialize the options for saving in PDF format using [PdfSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/tex/java/com.aspose.tex.rendering/PdfSaveOptions)
4. Run LaTeX to PDF conversion using [TeXJob](https://apireference.aspose.com/tex/java/com.aspose.tex/TeXJob) method
