In order to render LATEX to TIFF, weâ€™ll use <a href="https://products.aspose.com/tex/java">Aspose.TeX for Java</a> API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from <a href="https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-tex">Maven</a> and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

1. Initialize [TeXOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/tex/java/com.aspose.tex/TeXOptions) to create conversion options for Object LaTeX format
2. In order to set space, or area, where the TeX output will be written, set system working directory for the output using [OutputWorkingDirectory](https://apireference.aspose.com/tex/java/com.aspose.tex/TeXOptions#getOutputWorkingDirectory--)
3. Initialize the options for saving in TIFF format using [TiffSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/tex/java/com.aspose.tex.rendering/TiffSaveOptions)
4. Run LaTeX to TIFF conversion using [TeXJob](https://apireference.aspose.com/tex/java/com.aspose.tex/TeXJob) method
